# Web development project 3 (IT2810)
This is the repository for our third project in web development. This project was centered around creating a mobile application using
react-native and the expo API. The app was to be independent of mobile platforms and include some form of user interaction/input
implemented with at least one of the expo APIs.

## Installation instructions
If you want to download and build this project yourself follow these instructions (assumes basic knowledge of git and npm/yarn).
You will need to have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your computer to run this app.

First clone the github repo to your local computer and `cd` into the root folder. Install all the dependencies using either npm or yarn.
You will also need to install `expo-cli` globally so that you can use the cli to run the application. If you want to be able to run the
tests you will also need to install `jest` globally. To start running the expo server run `npm start` or `yarn start` and to run the tests
run `npm test` or `yarn test`.
